            <div>
                Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all of the
                ways a website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the data of its
                visitors and customers. It usually also includes a statement regarding the website’s
                commitment to protecting its visitors’ or customers’ privacy, and an explanation
                about the different mechanisms the website is implementing in order to protect
                privacy.

                Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues: the
                types of information the website is collecting and the manner in which it collects
                the data; an explanation about why is the website collecting these types of
                information; what are the website’s practices on sharing the information with third
                parties; ways in which your visitors and customers can exercise their rights
                according to the relevant privacy legislation; the specific practices regarding
                minors’ data collection; and much, much more.
