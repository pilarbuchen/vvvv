            <h2>Refund Policy - The Basics</h2>
            <div>
                Having said that, a Refund Policy is a legally binding document that is meant to
                establish the legal relations between you and your customers regarding how and if
                you will provide them with a refund. Online businesses selling products are
                sometimes required (depending on local laws and regulations) to present their
                product return policy and refund policy. In some jurisdictions, this is needed in
                order to comply with consumer protection laws. It may also help you avoid legal
                claims from customers that are not satisfied with the products they purchased.

            <h2>What To Include in the Refund Policy</h2>
            <div>
                Generally speaking, a Refund Policy often addresses these types of issues: the
                timeframe for asking for a refund; will the refund be full or partial; under which
                conditions will the customer receive a refund; and much, much more.
